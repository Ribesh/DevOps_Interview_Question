# Port is Not Accessible even after Port Mapping in Docker


1. Recheck if the right port is used when running the docker run
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:80 <image_name>
    ```

2.  Check firewall settings
    ```bash
    ufw
    ```

    ```bash
    firewall-cmd 
    ```

3. Check if the port is used by any other service in the host machine

    ```bash
    lsof -i :<port>
    ```

    ```bash
    netstat -tulnp | grep :<port>
    ```

4. Docker Logs
    ```bash
    docker logs -f <container_name>
    ```
