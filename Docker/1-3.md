## Q. You encounter a docker image with size 2.7 GB. Will this be a cause of concern? How will you tackle this?

### Answer:

1. The bigger the docker image the **longer the build time**
2. **Docker image download error** or **API rate limit issues**
3. **Application** will also become **bulkier**


### Solution:

1. Smaller base Images (alpine)
2. Multi-Stage Docker Builds when buidling docker images
3. Remove package binaries after installation and don't install packages that isn't required
