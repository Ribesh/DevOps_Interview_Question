# App crashed with "Permission Denied" in the container

-   The user might be using personal user or root user with elevated permission while building locally

-   But when the same DevOps engineer write a dockerfile, they might be creating a user that might not have permission to access the file where the application is present
    -   This can be easily fixed by using
        ```bash
        chown appuser:appuser 
        ```

        OR
        ```bash
        chmod +x <file_path>
        ```
