# Docker host is running out of disk space. How do you clean up?

1. Check the current disk utilization
    ```bash
    docker system df
    ```

2.  Clean dangling images that are not used
    ```bash
    docker system prune
    docker system prune -a
    ```

3. Remove unused volumes
    ```bash
    docker volume prune
    ```

4. Verify
    ```bash
    docker system df
    ```
