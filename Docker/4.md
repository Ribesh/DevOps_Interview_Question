# Data is Lost when container stops and restarts

-   By default, docker containers are ephemeral in nature
    -   That means, anything stored inside the container is lost when the container is restarted

-   However, by using the concept of Docker volumes, we can preserve the data in containers.

## 2 Ways to create Volume

    ```bash
    docker create volume <volume_name>
    ```

    OR
    ```bash
    docker run -v mydata:/etc/data <image_name>
    ```

## 2 Types of Volume

1. Persistent Volume
    -   the location in the host machine is
    ```/var/lib/docker/volumes```   

2. Bind Mounts
    -   You can specify any location of the host file
