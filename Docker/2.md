# What is the purpose of EXPOSE in Dockerfile?

-   Just for documentation purpose (metadata)
    -   So, that when you share your Dockerfile with other people, they know which port should be opened while looking at the Dockerfile

    ```bash
    docker run -it --name nginx --port 8080:8080 nginx
    ```
