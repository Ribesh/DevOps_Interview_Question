# Docker Container Exits Immediately

-   Docker containers are meant to be a **single process containers.**

    -   If the command or process specified in the container completes quickly, then the container might exit right after the container is started
        

        -   Or maybe if it fails immediately


-   Whenever you run a docker container, the command in the CMD or the command in ENTRYPOINT is executed.

-   Lets say:
    -   The CMD or ENTRYPOINT Command is `echo "Hello World" `
        -   This command runs maybe in less than 1 second.
        -   In such cases, right after you run the `docker run` command the container is exited


    -   nginx in the ENTRYPOINT

-  Verify the logs
    ```bash
    docker logs -f <container_name>
    ```

-   If you don't want the container to stop, run in interactive mode

    ```bash
    docker run -it nginx:latest
    ```
