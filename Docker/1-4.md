## Q. What is the difference between docker images vs docker layers?


### Answer:

1. Docker layers is not a separate component, it is a **subsidiary part of Docker image**.

2. **Each layer is an image itself**

3. They are generated when you run docker container commands i.e docker build

4. Each image layers stores the changes compared to the previous base image.

5. Each instruction in a `Dockerfile` results to a layer

5. You can used the `docker history` command to get more information about the layers
