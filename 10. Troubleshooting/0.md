## Q1: Describe a critical production incident you handled. Use the STAR method
**Scenario:** Behavioral question testing problem-solving and communication.

### Answer:
**Expected structure (STAR):**
- **Situation:** What was the context? (e.g., Black Friday traffic spike)
- **Task:** What was your responsibility?
- **Action:** What did you do? (step-by-step technical response)
- **Result:** What was the outcome? (quantified impact if possible)

**Example answer:**
- **Situation:** "Payment service was returning 500 errors during peak checkout time"
- **Task:** "I was on-call for infrastructure"
- **Action:** "Checked metrics → Found database connection pool exhaustion → Checked logs → Slow query identified → Killed long-running transaction → Scaled database connections → Implemented connection pooling → Deployed fix"
- **Result:** "Restored service in 15 minutes, prevented $50K+ in lost sales, implemented connection pooling to prevent recurrence"


## Q2: Your deployment caused an outage. How do you approach the post-mortem?
**Why ask:** Tests blameless culture, learning mindset, and process thinking.

### Answer:
1. **Immediate recovery:** Rollback, stabilize service
2. **Post-mortem process:**
   - Schedule meeting within 24 hours
   - Gather timeline of events
   - Document what went wrong (not who)
   - Identify root cause (usually multiple factors, not single person)
   - Define action items to prevent recurrence
3. **Blameless culture:**
   - Focus on process/system failures, not human error
   - Examples: "Better testing would have caught this" vs "QA was careless"
4. **Follow-up:**
   - Implement action items
   - Share learnings with team
   - Update runbooks/documentation
5. **Continuous improvement:**
   - Identify patterns across multiple incidents
   - Invest in automation


## Q34: How do you handle a difficult customer situation?
**Why ask:** Customer-facing role; tests communication and empathy.

### Answer:
**Expected approach:**
1. **Listen actively:** Understand their concern fully
2. **Acknowledge impact:** "I understand your service is down, affecting your business"
3. **Communicate status:** Provide updates regularly (every 15-30 min during incident)
4. **Set expectations:** Realistic timelines for resolution
5. **Involve senior support if needed:** Escalate complex issues
6. **Follow up:** Ensure satisfaction, document learnings
7. **Preventive measures:** Suggest improvements to prevent recurrence
