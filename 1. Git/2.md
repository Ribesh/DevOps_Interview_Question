## Q2: If you were to make a changes for a commit done 30 days ago with respect to a machine type used? How would you go about doing this change?

Whould you directly change it?

- Answer: 

### Steps
1. `git clone` repo

2. `git checkout` or create a new branch

3. Use github UI or CLI to take advantage of  `git blame` (history) 
    -   **`git blame` show who last modified each line of the file - usefull for debugging, auditing, or understanding history.**
        -   To understand who make changes to this particular file
        -   What was the change made
        -   What was to git commit message

4. Using this, I would try to understand the reason for the previous commit

5. Then, I will make my commit

```bash
git blame app.py
```
