# Explain the Deployment strategies that you used in the past

1. Canary
2. Blue Green


## Blue Green
-   Say, current version is v1 and newer version is v2
-   We try to create complete new environment for v2 version of the application
-   So, lets say v1 is deployed on a VM
    -   So, we try to create a new VM and deploy the new v2 onto the new VM
    -   And, point the load balancer to the new version of VM
    -   We create exactly same resources as the old VM like memory, CPU

- In case of significant issue, we point the loadbalancer to the OLD VM
