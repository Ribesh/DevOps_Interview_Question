# Q. Why is hardcoding Pod IP communication is a bad practice?

- I will try to explain the developers mentioning that `Pods` are **ephemeral** is nature
    -   Pod can go down because of resource issues
    -   Pod can go down because of crash loop, back off, or multiple other reasons

-   When ever a `Pod` goes down in Kubernetes, **IP address can be changed**
    -   If you hard code the IP address of `Pod B` in `Pod A's` environment varaible
        -   Next time, if the Pod B comes up with a different IP address
        -   This will lead to errors to the clients


-   To avoid this, Kubernetes uses a concept called `Services`
    -   Instead of using IP addresses, `Services` use **Labels & Selectors** for communication

    -   This ensures that if the pod is the same one or the pod has been terminated and recreated, IP addresses might change but ensures communication
