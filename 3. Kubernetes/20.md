# Difference between liveness and readiness probe

- It is similar to `ALB` in AWS
    -   It check if the target groups is healthy or not
    -   Only redirects the traffic to healthy machines

- `Liveness Probe` can be configured in the pod definition to check if the application is **alive or not**
    ```bash
    livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
            path: /health
            port:   8080
        initialDeplaySeconds: 10
        periodSeconds: 5
    ```
    -   If the health check doesn't return 200 status code, Kubernetes will automatically restart the pod or the container
        -   If the restart occurs multiple times, then it can go to crash loop back off state.

    -   Maybe it might got stuck for some reason, and a single restart might bring your container to normal state.


- `Readiness Probe` is also configured in the Pod definition to check if the pod is ready to serve the traffic
    -   Sometimes, your application might be in a running state, but your application might not be in a state to serve traffic

    -   Example:
        -   Say, there is a backend container which is up and running
        -   However, to server traffic backend might need a supporting container or a database 
            -   If the database container is not up, when users makes a request the backend can take the request but it has to forward the request to the database and fetch some information, which can cause unexpected issues

    ```bash
    readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port:  8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 10
    ```
