# Q. How various components of Kubernetes interact?


1. When user creates a request to create a pod on the cluster
    -   Initially, the request is sent to the API Server of the control plane
    -   `API Server` performs, authorization and authentication to verify if the user has the permisison to apply changes to the cluster


2. If the user has the permissions, the API server forward the request to the `Scheduler`

    -   `Scheduler` tried to identify which nodes in the kubernetes cluster is right for the pod
        -   Its looks as the Pod Definitions, to identify 
            1. If any **node affinity** is set
            2. If any **node selector** is set
            3. If any **taint** is set
            4. It also takes into account which nodes are free in the cluster
    -   Finally, it makes a decision to schedule a pod to a node

3. Then, API Server talks to the kubelet of that particular node and `kubelet` invokes container runtime
    -   Container runtime is need to run a container

4.  Once the pod is running, the `API Server` updates the information to `ETCD` to persists the information

5. If your pod goes down, there is a `replicaset controller` which takes care of pods, which is managed by `Controller Manager`
