# Explain the different betwwen Ingress and LB service Type

- Both Ingress and Load Balancer service types are used to expose the application to the external work or to allow public access to the application

-   However, there is a difference between load balancer and ingress
    -   When you go for loadbalancer service type, for every `service` that you expose, you need a unique `load balancer`
    -   Which is quite expensive
    -   Also, you don't have control of the load balancer that gets created
        -   It is up to the **Cloud Control Manager** Component to decide which load balancer is created



-   `Ingress` exposes the application to the external world, but it provides you a lot of configuration options. 
    -   For multiple services, you can use the same load balancer
        -   You can simply create target groups in the load balancer using ingress resource
            -   So that request is routed from the load balancer to multiple service backends

    -   **More cost effective**  
    -   Can customize the ingress resource
    -   Can choose the load balancer using ingress controller

        -   For example:
            -   If you use Nginx Ingress Controller
                -   You can go for **Nginx Ingress Controller** & **AWS NLB**
