## Q. We want to launch centain pods only on specific nodes. These nodes should explicitly used only for this nodes. Is this possible to control deployments of such pods in the given scenario?

Answer:

-   Yes, this can be achieved by **Taints**

-   We can add a taint to a node
    ```bash
    kubeclt taint nodes <node_name> key=value:Effect
    ```

-   Taints are a property of nodes that push pods away if they don't tolerate the taint
    -   This means that the nodes must not accept any pods that doesn't tolerate all of the taints
    -   Like Labels, one or more Taints can be applied to a node


### Effects:

**NoSchedule** → Pods that don’t tolerate the taint won’t be scheduled on the node.

**PreferNoSchedule** → Kubernetes will try to avoid placing pods here, but may if necessary.

**NoExecute** → New pods won’t schedule and existing non-tolerant pods will be evicted.


### Toleration (inside Pod spec)
```bash
tolerations:
- key: "key"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```


## Example Scenario

🏷️ Step 1: Add a taint to the GPU node
```bash
kubectl taint nodes node3 gpu=true:NoSchedule
```

Step 2: Create a pod that tolerates this taint

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: gpu-container
    image: nvidia/cuda:12.2-base
  tolerations:
  - key: "gpu"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
