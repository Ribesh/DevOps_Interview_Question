# Q. What are the types of Services in Kuberneters

-   There are 3 types of Services in Kubernetes
    1.  Cluster IP (Internal)
        -   For example
            -   Any pods within the Kubernetes cluster, irrespective of the namespace, can access the service using `Cluster_IP` or `DNS name` associated with the services

    2.  Node Port (External)
        -   Kubernetes exposes a special port on the Kubernetes nodes
        -   So you can access the service using `Node IP: Port`


    3.  Load Balancer (External or Public Access)
        -   Only works on clusters that has cloud controller manager
        -   Your local kubernetes installation like minikube, kubeadm doesn't have this component.


    4.   External Name
        -   Special Type of Service
        -   Doesn't create a Service like above
        -   It enables external Access through DNS Name
            -   So, you can use external DNS name to access pods within the Kubernetes cluster
    
    5.  Headless Services
        -   When we define `Cluster IP to None` 
        -   This is commonly used for stateful sets or DNS based service discovery.
