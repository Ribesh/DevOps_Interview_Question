## Q. What is KOps?

Answer:

1. KOps is an automation tool used to setup kubernetes cluster **on any cloud service** instead of using `kubeadm`

2.  It helps automate the **whole creation process, destory, upgrade & maintain the cluster**. 

3. Kops is not something that will help you setup managed Kubenetes cluster (EKS) 
    - if you intend to spin a test cluster or a small dev cluster then kops can do it quickly



## Q. Can't I simple use kubeadm instead?

Answer:

-  Yes, you can.

- However, when you setup kubernetes in the cloud you would need 
    1. Integration with **EBS for volumes**,
    2. Integration with **EC2 for spinning up machines**
    3. Integration with **ASG for spinning up Auto-Scaling Group**
    4. **Route 53**


-   The issue you will face with `kubeadm` is integration with **AWS Services**.
    -   This is where **KOps** comes into picture


-   As of today, it supports
    1. AWS
    2. Azure
    3. GCE
    4. DigitalOcean
    5. OpenStack (beta)
    6. AliCloud
