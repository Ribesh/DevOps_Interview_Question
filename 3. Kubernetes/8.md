# How Kubernetes Services are related to Kube-Proxy?

-   First a Kubernetes Services is created

-   Labels is associated to the pods

-   Selectors are applied to the service

-   Services identifies the right pods and Kubernetes creates something call Endpoint which is basically the IP address of the Service

-   This endpoint is read by kube-proxy

-   Kube-proxy updates the IP tables to route the request to the replica of pods

- This is how kube-proxy works
