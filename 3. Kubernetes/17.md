# Explain the role of CoreDNS in Kubernetes

-   CoreDNS is the default DNS Server on K8 cluster
    -   It takes care of domain to IP address translation

-   Lets say a pod wants to communicate with a service
    -   payments.default.svc.cluster.local

-   When a Pod tried to talk to this DNS name, it is translated to an IP address using a DNS server called CoreDNS
