# Q. What are labels and selectors in Kubernetes?

-   `Labels` are **key value pairs** that are used to **identify** or **group** the resources in kubernetes
-   `Selectors` are used for **query** purpose.
    -   `Services`,`Replicasets`, `Deployments` use the concept of `Selector` to *identify pods according to labels.*


## Labels
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: myapp-Pod
    labels:
        app: myapp
```


## Selectors

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Services
metadata:
    name: myapp-services
specs:
    selectors:
        app: myapp
```
