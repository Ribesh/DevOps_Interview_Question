## Q. What is PV and PVC in kubernetes? What roles do they play?

Answer:

Full Form:
PV  ➡️ Persistent Volume
PVC ➡️ Persistent Volume Claim


- Lets say, we have a pod that has a container running.
    -   The container is in need of a volume
    -   Why would a container be in need for a volume?
        -   Maybe to write some logs
        -   Maybe to dump some information

-   So the question is, where will it get the volume?
    -   What happens is the pod will get hold of PVC, which will actually get hold of PV which will then share the volume.
