# Q. What would you recommend NodePort Service or LoadBalancer Type service and Why?


-   Node Port and Load Balancer Service are two types of Serivies of Kubernetes

-   Kubernetes service of type `NodePort` is only accessible using the `Node IP`, followed by the port associated to the service.
    -   **Scope:  Only to the people who can access this node (means internally)**


-   If i want to expose my service to be **public**
    -   We can access the service using the `LoadBalancer IP`


-   If you want to restrict it within your organization, use NodePort

-   However, if you want the service to be accessed only within the cluster
    -   Used Cluster IP


-   Load Balancer Service type is only available on the K8 clusters which have Cloud Controller Manager running
    -   Without Cloud Controller Manager, even if you create a service of load balancer, it will still work as NodePort service
