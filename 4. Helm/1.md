## Q. Do you use Helm? What version of Helm do you use and do you see the benefit of using helm?

### Answer:

-   Yes, we use helm

-   Helm version is 3 for all new applications (Helm 2 is previous version)

-   Helm is basically packaging all your kubernetes files into a single chart format which will help in
    1. Deployments
    2. Rollbacks
    3.  Upgrade
    4.  Prod, Staging, Dev Setup


-   For a single application in kubernetes, you might end up writing multiple yaml files as part of the application.
    -   You might have
        -   Deployments
        -   ReplicaSets
        -   Service Accounts
    
    -   If you were to have 20 different kinds of applications running, it becomes a lot difficult to manage everything in Kubernetes just by using the yaml file


-   The solution that was bought was Helm Charts
    -   All the yaml files are combined to a single format called chart where it used templating format to make us easier to maintain charts.
    -   The beauty of Helm chart is just by altering the value file, we will be able to make multiple kinds of deployments
        -   Production Deployment
        -   Staging Deployment
        -   Dev Deployment
    -   It also makes deployment, rollback and upgrade easy while maintaining multiple sets of environments.
