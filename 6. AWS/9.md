## Q. How is your K8's setup done in AWS? Please explain?

### Answer:

-   Many ways to setup K8 in AWS
    1.  EKS
    2.  EC2 - KOps
    3.  EC2 - Kubeadm

-   For Production environment are always using for EKS,
    -   For Dev Environment, we are using KOps in EC2 instance

-   The reason for choosing EKS, is
    1. Less maintainability from our end
    2. Lots of flexibility in terms compatibility with AWS Services.
