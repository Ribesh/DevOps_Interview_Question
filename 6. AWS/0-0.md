## Q1: Design an AWS architecture for a highly available, scalable web application
**Why ask:** Tests system design thinking and AWS knowledge.

### Answer:
**Expected components:**
- **Compute:** Auto Scaling Group across multiple AZs
- **Load Balancing:** Application Load Balancer (ALB) for traffic distribution
- **Database:** RDS Multi-AZ for high availability
- **Storage:** S3 for static assets, CloudFront for CDN
- **Networking:** VPC with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway
- **Security:** Security Groups, NACLs, IAM policies, encryption
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch, auto-scaling policies based on metrics

**Diagram or description should include:**
- At least 2 AZs for fault tolerance
- Health checks at ALB level
- Database failover mechanism
- Backup strategy

## Q2: Explain AWS IAM and how you implement the principle of least privilege.

### Answer:
-   IAM = Global Service
-   IAM controls who can sign in and what they can do

#### Least privilege (meaning)

The principle of least privilege means: give only the minimum permissions needed to do the job—nothing extra—so mistakes or stolen credentials cause less damage

#### How to implement least privilege

-   **Start with no permissions** (AWS default for new IAM users) and add only what’s required.​

-   **Prefer giving permissions to groups/roles**, not directly to individual users, so access stays consistent and reviewable.​

-   Write policies that are narrow in 3 ways:

    -   **Limit actions** (only the needed API calls).​

    -   **Limit resources** (specific bucket/ARN, not *).​
    -   **Add conditions when possible** (extra rules like “only from this network” or “only with MFA”) because IAM policies support conditional access logic.​

-   Use roles for workloads and automation so services/apps use temporary credentials instead of long-lived access keys.


## Q3: How do you manage networking in AWS (VPC, subnets, routing)?
**Why ask:** Networking fundamentals for production deployments.

### Answer

- **VPC:** Isolated network with custom CIDR blocks
- **Subnets:** Public (routable to IGW) vs Private (routable to NAT)
- **Routing:** Route tables for directing traffic
- **Multi-AZ design:** Subnets across AZs for high availability
- **Common issues:** 
  - Overlapping CIDR blocks (use Transit Gateway)
  - Connectivity troubleshooting (security groups, NACLs, route tables)
  - VPC Peering for cross-VPC communication

**Real scenario:** "When debugging connectivity issues between two services, I check: security groups → network ACLs → route tables → actual route table entries"


## Q4: Walk me through your approach to AWS troubleshooting
**Why ask:** Problem-solving methodology under uncertainty.

### Answer:
**Expected systematic approach:**
1. **Identify the problem:** What's failing exactly? (application error vs infrastructure error)
2. **Gather information:** CloudWatch logs, metrics, X-Ray traces
3. **Isolate components:** Network → Infrastructure → Application
4. **Check common culprits:**
   - Security groups blocking traffic
   - IAM permissions insufficient
   - Resource limits exceeded (ELB connection limit, RDS IOPS)
   - Configuration drift
5. **Verify resolution and document:** Post-mortem, knowledge base update

**Example:** "When an ECS task wouldn't start, I checked: CloudWatch container logs → CloudWatch events → ECS task details → IAM task role permissions → volume mount issues"
