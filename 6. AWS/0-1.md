## Q: Your team wants to adopt Docker for development but is concerned about inconsistencies between local environments and production. How can AWS Cloud9 help address this challenge?

### Answer: 
Cloud9 ensures consistency through:

-   Standardized Environments: Cloud9 instances provide identical development environments based on Docker, preventing "works on my machine" issues.
    
-   Image-Based Development: Dockerfiles encapsulate all dependencies, making environments self-contained and replicable across machines an d into production.

Production Parity: The same Docker images used in development can be deployed in production, reducing environment-specific surprises.
