## Q. Auto Scaling Group for a project is having issues with getting/provisioning new nodes? Its using complete **Spot Instances**. What could be the issue?


### Answer:

-   First of all having a ASG full of only spot instances is not a good idea 
    -   Unless the application can support a bit of downtime 
    -   Because Spot Instances can be taken away from you, if there is change in the bid price, which is the fundamental of spot instances


-   Even if you bid too high, it doesn't gaurantee the spot instances

-   So, the 2 main reasons could be:
    1.  Increase in Spot Prices
    2.  EC2 Quota Limit 
        -   There is a soft limit applied to each and every AWS account so that even if a hacker get access to the account and he won't be able to spin up many machines
        -   To remove/increase this limit, you need to contact AWS support
