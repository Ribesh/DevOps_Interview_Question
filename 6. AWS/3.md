## Q. Could you explain how you would block an IAM user for accessing a specifc S3 Bucket?

### Answer:

-   If you are thinking you can do this via IAM Policy then you are wrong.

-   The right way to do this is via S3 Bucket Policy.
    -   In the Bucket Policy, you can mention ARN of the IAM user & and the permission this IAM user has.

    -   If you put the permission as Block, then the particular user will not be able to access the Bucket.
