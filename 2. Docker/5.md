# You made changes in your code, rebuilt the image, but the change isn't reflected?

-   First, when be build an image, it could take 10 minutes.
    -   Later, if we rebuild the image again making minor changes, only the layers that is changed is updated.... rest of the layers are cached
    -   Since, you have updated your code and rebuilt the code but still not changes happened. 
        -   It could be due to Layer caching
            -  It is rare but could happen


-   Use below command to build with no-cache
    ```bash
    docker build --no-cache -t <image>:<tag> <location_of_Dockerfile>
    ```
