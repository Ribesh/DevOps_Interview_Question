## Q. How to check logs from my docker container and how to filter only last 200 lines from container logs?

- Answer : 

```bash
docker logs <container_id>

docker logs -f <container_id>

docker logs --tail 200 <container_id>
```

## Q2: Explain Docker and its benefits in a DevOps environment
**Why ask:** Container fundamentals for modern DevOps.

### Answer:
**Expected knowledge:**
- Containers: *Lightweight*, isolated application environments
- Benefits: *Consistency* ("works on my machine" solved), portability, efficiency
- Components: Images, containers, registries
- Layers: Immutable layers in Docker images for optimization
- Best practices: Minimal base images, single process per container, security scanning

**Follow-up:** "How would you optimize a Docker image size?"
- Answers: Multi-stage builds, minimal base images (Alpine), layer caching, removing unnecessary packages

## Q3: How would you implement zero-downtime deployments in Kubernetes?
**Why ask:** Tests understanding of production-safe deployment strategies.

### Answer:
**Expected strategies:**
- **Rolling Deployment:** Gradually replace old pods with new ones
  - Controlled by `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` parameters
  - Health checks ensure only healthy pods receive traffic
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Two identical environments, switch traffic
- **Canary Deployment:** Route small percentage to new version, monitor, gradually increase
- **Implementation considerations:**
  - Proper liveness/readiness probes
  - Graceful shutdown handling (pre-stop hooks)
  - Database schema backward compatibility
  - Configuration management for seamless updates

**Code example expected:** "In our Helm chart, we use readinessProbe to ensure only ready pods receive traffic, and preStop hook to wait for in-flight requests to complete"


## Q4: Design a Kubernetes cluster for a multi-tenant SaaS application
**Scenario:** Advanced architectural question.

### Answer:
**Expected considerations:**
- **Isolation:** Separate namespaces per tenant, network policies
- **Resource allocation:** Resource quotas and limits per namespace
- **Security:** RBAC, pod security policies, network segmentation
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus/Grafana for per-tenant metrics
- **Scaling:** HPA for auto-scaling based on demand
- **Storage:** Persistent volumes with access controls
- **Cost optimization:** Node affinity, pod priority, resource optimization

**Follow-up:** "How would you prevent one tenant's workload from affecting another?"
- Expected: `Network policies`, resource quotas, pod disruption budgets, priority classes
