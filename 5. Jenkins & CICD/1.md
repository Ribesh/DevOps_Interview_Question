## Q. Can we have a Jenkins agent which is a docker container and run our test inside this container


### Answer:

-   To use any kind of Docker Images, I would add it as part of agent.
    -   We can use any images from Docker Hub or custom Images we have built

    -   And whatever the stages and test steps we will mention as part of our pipeline

        ```bash
        pipeline {
            agent {
                docker { image 'node:16.13.1-alpine' }
            }

            stages{
                stage('Test'){
                    steps{
                        sh 'node --version'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```


-   This is used for isolation of pipeline steps

-   Here the code is expected to run inside a docker container which can use custom test image if required

-   This is the best way to perform testing without having every jenkins agent needing to have packages installed.
