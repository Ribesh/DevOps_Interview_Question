# Explain the Rollback strategy that you follow in your organization


-   We have a deployment stragety: `Canary` where we gradually rollout the new version of the application to the users
    -   So, initially the new version of the application is only rolled out to 10% of users and rest are using old version.
    -   Then, we gradually change that to 20%, 50% and 100% to avoid major issue in the production


-   But lets say, due to some reasons, there is still a major issue in production
    -   As a part of rollback strategy, I will just revert the helm chart, deployment file, config map, secrets to the previous version.
    -   Now, when helm chart is reverted to the previous version, that means a change is made to the git repository.
    -   ArgoCD is watching the git repository
        -   As soon as the changes is created, ArgoCD will automatically pick up the old version and deploy onto the Kubernetes cluster.
