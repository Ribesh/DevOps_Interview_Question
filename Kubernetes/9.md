# What is the disadvantage of load balancer service type?

-   It provisions an seperate external IP and load balancer instance for each service, which have be very expensive especially in load environments.

-   Example:
    -   Imagine we are in AWS and are using EKS
    -   When ever we create a SVC, immediately a ALB is created
    -   But when we create another SVC, the existing ALB is not using, instead a new ALB is created
    -   If we have 10 SVC, 10 ALB is created, which is huge costing


-   To avoid this we have to go with Ingress.
