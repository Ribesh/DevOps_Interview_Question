# Explain the deployment strategy that you follow in your organization?

-   There are 2 popular deployment strategies
    1.  Canary
    2.  Blue-Green

-   In our organization, we follow `Canary Deployment Strategy`
    -   As a devops engineer, i will create a new `ingress resource` service and a new version of the `pod`
    -   I will add `annotation` to the `ingress resource`
        -   So that the load balancer is configured to **send 10% traffic** to the `ingress resource`
        -   Eventully, I will update this to 20%, 50% and 100%, so that 100% traffic is redirected to the new version of the pod
            -   Once all the traffic is sent to this pod, I will delete old ingress, old service and old pod.
