# Your app works with ClusterIP but fails with Ingress. How do you troubleshoot it

-   Many people make mistake when they plan to expose the application to the outside world
    -   They just create an ingres resource and they assume everything is done

## Troubleshooting Steps:

1.  Ingress Controller is installed or not
    -   It watches the `ingress resource` and creates a `load balancer`


2.  If `Ingress Controller` is created, check **Ingress Controller logs**
    -   Check if `ingress resource` is watched by the `Ingress Controller` or not


3.  Ingress Class Name
    -   When there are multiple ingress controllers in your cluster, you need to define which ingress resource should be watched by which ingress controller
