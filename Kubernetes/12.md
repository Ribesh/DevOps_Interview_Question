# Explain how you can restrict access to db pod to only one app in the namespace?

-   We can leverage a concept in kubernetes called Network Policies.
    -   Using Network Policies, we can block access to a pod or restrict it only from certain pods

## Steps
-   Firstly, you need to labels the pods
    - Say, 
        ```bash
        labels:
            app: db
        ```  

-   Then go to the Application Pod and create another label
    -   Say,
        ```bash
        labels:
            app: my-app
        ```

-   Create a Kubernetes resource of `kind: NetworkPolicy`, in which i will provide the ingress configuration
    -   To only allow traffic from this particular application
