# Why do I need to setup Ingress Controller after creating Ingress?


-   Just like Pod, Deployments you can create ingress resources
    -   Typically `kind: Ingress`

-   However, out of the box there is not controller watching ingress resources
    -   You need to setup ingress controllers to watch ingress resources and configure a load balancer
    -   Example:
        -   When you create a deployment manifest, a replica set controller is watching it and creates pods
    


-   This way your can route the request from the load balancer to your pods and enable external access to your application.


-   there are multiple ingress controllers in market
    -   if you need Nginx Load Balancer ➡️ use Nginx Controller
    -   if you need Kong Load Balancer ➡️ use Kong Controller
    -   if you need traefik Load Balancer ➡️ use traefik Controller
