# Q. What is the purpose of Services in Kubernetes

-   In Kubenetes, Services takes care of very critical activity which is **service discovery.**
    -   For example:
        -   When a Pod A wants to communicate with Pod B, basically internal communications in the Kubernetes cluster

        -   Since `Pods` are **ephemeral in nature**, `Pod A` cannot communicate with `Pod B` with IP Address.
            -   Because if Pod B goes down, **IP Address might change**

            -   To avoid this scenario, `Pod A` communicates with the `Service` associated with `Pod B`

            -   And the `Service` communicates with `Pod B`, not using IP address, by using **advanced algorithm called labels and selectors.**

        -   Because `Services` identified the pods using **labels and selectors**, request from Pod A to Pod B is never terminated


-   Kubernetes services can also help with default **load balancing**
    -   If there are multiple `Replicas` of the same `Pod`, `Services` ensure that the requests are split between two replicas or multiple `Replicas` of the `Pod`
        -   By default it follows round robin algorithm
